How to build
--------------------------------
We're using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), so you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) first. The easiest way to get Node on Windows is [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org):

    choco install nodejs.install 

With Node.js installed on your system, you can use npm to install Gulp on your machine:

    npm install --global gulp

Now you're almost ready to build. You can run ```Build.bat``` or run the following commands in the command line:

    npm install
    gulp
