ExitStrategy is a set of tools that will help WebForms and MVC live together in one Asp.net webapplication.

We provide the following:
- Guidance on how WebForms and MVC can live together in one project
- WebForms controls that will allow you to re-use your MVC Views in the WebForms world

It's ultimate goal is to help you slowly migrate away from WebForms into the new and shiny MVC-world. That's why you
won't find any tools to integrate WebForms into MVC, just tools to integrate the new MVC things into
your legacy WebForms pages.

You can see a [demo site here](http://exitstrategy.apphb.com/).
